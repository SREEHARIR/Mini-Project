# Pill Dispenser

The automatic medication dispenser gives the right pills at the right moment and also sounds an alarm so that the person who needs those pills knows it's time for his or her medication. The dispenser also saves the alarms to an EEPROM so that the alarms are not lost when a power outage occurs. An RTC is used to get accurate reading of time, which also switches to a secondary power source during power failure, so that the time is also not lost.
